# Appwrite Next.js Authentication

Next.JS App that uses Appwrite as its backend. It features:

- A simple signup and login flow, powered by [Appwrite's web SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/appwrite)
- Two API routes that handle User data. Both routes require authorization which is done through [Appwrite's Node SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-appwrite). More about them on [API Routes](#api-routes)
